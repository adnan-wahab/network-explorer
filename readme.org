"For any movie lover that wants to take a more active role in discovering movies, my project allows them to navigate movie recommendations based on attributes

I used Move Genome Project as the data source. 

Let me show you a demo. You start by searching for a movie. Then you see the characteristics associated with that move. Then you can browse from there to other movies that also match those traits. Then you can click to watch a trailer of that movie if available.

Something like this can be another way to browse the Netflix catalog for example. 

Where I see this project going from here is to add [x, y, z] features."
